To pay for college, I started a tutoring business. As part of the business, I have actively supported students several students at top 20 colleges. For students at colleges like the LSE (8 courses) and UCL (10 courses), I have tutored 30+ courses in business & management, finance & accounting, history, law, literature, mathematics, philosophy, political science, and psychology.
