**Abstract**:
This dissertation seeks to understand how prejudice influences the labor market outcomes of the Roma in the Czech Republic. Drawing from the theoretical frameworks of Bertrand (2004) and Bertrand and Duflo (2023), I conduct the first fully automated interview callback field experiment using a generative AI program. I model the differences in interview callbacks for white and Roma applicants using Logit and Linear Probability Models. The results reveal substantial racial disparities in callback rates that vary significantly across industries and regions but not with an applicant's qualifications. The results are clearly summarized in the figure below. Specifically, I identify three high-discrimination industries, three low-discrimination industries, three high-discrimination regions, and four low-discrimination regions. The Roma achieve equal treatment only in jobs that are both in a low-discrimination region and a low-discrimination industry. White applicants have a 4.2 times higher likelihood of receiving an interview callback in high-discrimination industries based in low-discrimination regions. Similarly, white applicants have a 2.1 times greater probability of securing an interview in low-discrimination industries situated in high-discrimination regions. Finally, white applicants have a 12.8 times greater likelihood of obtaining an interview in a high-discrimination industry located in a high-discrimination region.
