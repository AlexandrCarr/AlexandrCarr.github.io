My favorite classes in 2024/5 focussed on portfolio construction and optimization. I think it's a beautiful computational problem that stands out among most math problems because it can be simultaneously approached with mathematics, computer science, economics, finance, political science, and history. This excited me so much that I wanted to start building my own models. However, there was virtually no reliable data online nor in MIT's internal databases. As such, I decided to pay the fixed cost and built the largest dataset of public equities for MIT students (to the best of my knowledge and as of May 2025). 

The dataset provides 45 fundamental and technical indicators for the members of the Russell 1000 from June 2000 to May 2025. The data is point-in-time, cleaned, and ready for analysis. It is now used for problem sets for over 100 graduate students and helps students for technical interviews in quantitative finance. 

I hope you have fun exploring the data!!!
