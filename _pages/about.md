Hi there! I am Alex, a graduate student at MIT, pursuing coursework and research in finance, computer science, and statistics. 

I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Edinburgh in 2024, ranking top of my cohort in Economics with Applied Mathematics, and was going to pursue a PhD in Economics at Oxford. Although conceptually exciting, I found academic research to be a bit slow for me and wanted to work on applied and computationally complex problems, leading me to MIT's Master of Finance. Through internships and personal projects, I found quantitative finance to be fast-paced, meritocratic, intellectually stimulating, and was one of the few careers that allowed me to read papers in my spare time. This page serves as a repository of my projects and research, hoping to showcase my excitement for the field. 

I also love reading â€“ I was deciding between philosophy/literature and economics and applied mathematics in my freshman year. Beyond Russian and Magical Realism, most of my reading is focussed on economics (neo-mercantilism, potential de-dollarization, the economics of shifting geo-politics, and debt crises) and machine learning. Starting from July 2024, I am keeping a brief list of what I've read.
